**Learning Goals** Routing ins-and-outs, React hooks, implementing custom art pieces from wireframe into the project
  
**Challenges:** This project was supposed to be a flex project for what we knew in React. I know that I tend to be over-ambitious and under estimate things, which I was I chose a simple API with simple data manipulation. I ran into trouble with all aspects of this project mainly due to the constraint of time. I am someone who sees problems but can find 10 other ways to improve it.. so I do. This led to some amazing discoveries like figuring out how to add a hover element to five layers [the moon cards] or all of the different ways you can try to move API calls and state changes outside of App. This sort of creates an 'over-engineered aspect to the project. This led to troubles in error handling and cypress. Due to everything being so isolated from each other and keeping routing in both the card and at home, it caused a lot of unforeseen issues and behaviors. These challenges, like always, bring up a different perspective and means to refactor the way I attempted time goals. I've learned that I need to make a list of things I need to do and not touch anything else along the way. I am pretty good at reprioritizing which means that my goals shift frequently. This also makes me want to take more courses on trouble shoooting so that these problems that go from file to file are easier to capture
